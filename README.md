# Basic TestMoreRefFun

This tutorial demonstrates experiments, mostly of which are bad (but see how we delete from test3() and pointers in test4()). You can run into trouble trying to return references, though there are times you must (see later with OOP and the STL)

# Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.
In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor.
Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
